# Projects
## Analysis of Titanic passengers
This is an SQLite data analysis project that compares different passengers from Titanic and finds some information:
- oldest and youngest passengers on Titanic and information about them (age, class, number of relatives on board)
- most survivors by gender, age and class
- top 5 safest and cheapest cabins on Titanic for several people

## Cleanup, analysis and visualization of a database
This is a test exercise from HSE University. It required: 
- deleting unnecessary rows and data from a dataset (Excel table)
- grouping information in the same cluster with color
- visualizing different clusters on a scatter plot

The project required using Python (Pandas for the analysis and Matplotlib for the visualization).

## Analyzing importance of computers from 1987 to 1997
This project was done in Google Sheets. It is a task from the Codecademy course where you need to work with GDP of different categories from 1987 to 1997. The task was:
- to sort and filter the data in order to find the largest and the smallest categories by GDP for each year
- to find percentage of of each category relatively to the total GDP
- to create unique category for computers and to create a pivot table in order to check the importance of computers over the years and their influence on the total GDP

## Hotel data visualization
This project was done in Microsoft Excel. It is a task from the Codecademy course where you need to find and visualize patterns in raw data about hotel reservations. The data is divided by different categories to make a right conclusion.
