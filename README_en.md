This is an SQLite data analysis project that compares different passengers from Titanic and finds some information:
- oldest and youngest passengers on Titanic and information about them (age, class, number of relatives on board)
- most survivors by gender, age and class
- top 5 safest and cheapest cabins on Titanic for several people
